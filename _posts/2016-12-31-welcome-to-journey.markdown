Hi!

I'm a Software Developer and full-time living in Danang city, Vietnam

I love creating software and managed to turn that into my profession.

I have worked on software projects and games for my company and got to work with a bunch of different technologies, languages, tools, and methodologies.

The Tech's world is too big with many things to learning and understanding.

I think that go out Tech's world as a big adventure. The journey is too long and never ending.

Let's journey to Tech's World now!
